# Multiple-functionalities
This project was made to put into practice a large part of the thematic content of the languages: Javascript, HTML, CSS and SASS.
## Contenido
Multiple-functionalities is a proposal for the design and realization of projects, using different languages, by means of which an attempt is made to demonstrate to the potential client that the company is their best option to commission that idea they have in mind and make it a reality. This is demonstrated with the grouping of several mini-projects that come together and demonstrate the use of concepts that go from the basics, such as object handling, to something more advanced, such as the call and subsequent manipulation of information by through some APIs.
